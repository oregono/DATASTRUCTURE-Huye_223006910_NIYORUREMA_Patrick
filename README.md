The virtual whiteboard is a Python-based application that allows users to simulate a collaborative workspace where actions (such as drawing or erasing) can be tracked, and collaboration requests can be managed in a queue. The application uses a simple command-line interface to interact with users, allowing them to perform various tasks like adding actions, undoing the last action, and processing collaboration requests.
